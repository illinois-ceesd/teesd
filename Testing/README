======== General Info =======
CMake will automatically check the file (testdirectory.txt) for
a list of testing directories.  Each line of testdirectory.txt
should contain a TESTINGPATH.

For each TESTINGPATH, CMake will look for the file named
(./${TESTINGPATH}/testlist.txt). Each line of testlist.txt
should contain a TESTNAME.

For each TESTNAME, CMake will add a test executing the following:
python ./${TESTINGPATH}/${TESTNAME}.py ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}

The return code of the above command indicates whether the 
test passes or fails. (0=pass)

*Note: If the TESTNAME contains the word "FAILS", then
CMake will expect the test to FAIL and automatically 
flips the meaning of the exit code (0=fail).

====== Adding Tests ======
To ADD a test into an existing directory, add your test in
${TESTINGPATH}/${TESTNAME}.py, and add a line for your test
in ${TESTINGPATH}/testlist.txt

To ADD a new testing directory, make the directory and add
it to ./testdirectory.txt.

===== Example Test(s) =====
Look at any Python files in the Testing (i.e. *this*)
directory tree for testing examples. There is a set of
empty testing templates provided in:
./Examples/Example*.py
