# Python package for JustKernels

This is a set of Python interfaces and utilities for the [JustKernels](https://github.com/illinois-ceesd/justkernels)
project that tests computational kernels written in Fortran , parsed by [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy) to
generate OpenCL kernels targeting modern HPC platforms.

## PyJuKe

Python module (pyjuke.py) automatically generated by CMake which captures some information
about the environment, location of kernel F90 source files, etc. CMake uses the (pyjuke.sh)
utility to build the Python module at configuration-time.

## ParJuKe

Python module (parjuke.py) with some parallel utilities including error checking, and
parallel XML tools.

## ABaTe

Python module (ABaTe.py) encapsulates some ABaTe-specific functions for interacting with
CDash testing dashboard through the automated build-and-test system.  The ABaTe suite also
includes (generate_suite_runner.py) which is a utility used by ABaTe to form platform-specific
batch scripts that execute the test suites. ABaTe also includes the checktest utility
(CheckTest.py) that checks test results after batch scripts have run.

## Profiler

Python parallel profiler class (profiler.py) supporting parallel timings, automatic
barriers, timer reduction, and reporting.
