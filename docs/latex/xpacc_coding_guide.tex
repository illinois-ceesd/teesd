\hypertarget{xpacc_coding_guide_General}{}\section{Coding Style}\label{xpacc_coding_guide_General}
An existing and useful guide on C coding is the one for the Linux kernel here\+: \href{http://elixir.free-electrons.com/linux/latest/source/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst}{\tt Linux Kernel Coding Style Guide}

The Linux Kernel Style Guide is a bit overboard for our purposes, and doesn\textquotesingle{}t provide any C++-\/specific guidelines. The following is a start on some guidelines for C++, and some general exceptions to the guidelines presented in the Linux Kernel Style Guide.\hypertarget{xpacc_coding_guide_PlasCom2-specific}{}\section{Plas\+Com2-\/specific}\label{xpacc_coding_guide_PlasCom2-specific}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Braces -\/ use function-\/like braces (i.\+e. curly braces begin on next line) for the following C++ constructs\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Classes
\item Namespaces
\item Functions ( not strict, sometimes same-\/line braces make sense)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Use of namespaces
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Project-\/specific namespaces -\/ Each project should have its own namespace
\item Each major self-\/contained programmatic construct should be contained in a namespace (e.\+g. domain, grid, state)
\item The standard namespace, std, should be explicitly resolved on each construct from the standard namespace (as opposed to doing \char`\"{}using namespace std\char`\"{}. It is also acceptable to use specific functions from the standard namespace, e.\+g. \char`\"{}using std\+::cout\char`\"{}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Variable, function, and construct naming conventions
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item There is no need to be as pedantic about variable naming conventions as the Linux Kernel Style Guide. Just create readable, maintainable code.
\item Much of the code follows a loose variable naming scheme\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Start with lower case letters, followed by camel case (ex\+: delta\+Time, inter\+Face\+Normal)
\item Be descriptive with variable names, avoid things like {\itshape x}, and {\itshape tmp} for all but the most trivial and localized use
\item Embedding some type descriptions can be useful (ex\+: coordinates\+Ptr, x\+Value\+Vec), depending on context
\item Function names should be capitalized, camel case (ex\+: Get\+Current\+Time)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item When using references, use the same rule as for pointers where the reference qualifier rides with the variable name, not the type.~\newline
Like this\+:~\newline

\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keywordtype}{int} *pointerVar; (good)
\textcolor{keywordtype}{int} &referenceVar; (good)
\end{DoxyCode}
 {\bfseries Not} like this\+:~\newline

\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}* pointerVar; (other than good)
\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}& referenceVar; (other than good)
\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Use spaces between stream operators and their arguments\+:~\newline

\begin{DoxyCode}
std::cout << \textcolor{stringliteral}{"Hello world!"} << std::endl; (good)
std::cout<<\textcolor{stringliteral}{"Hardertoread"}<<std::endl; (other than good)
\end{DoxyCode}

\item File Names
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C-\/style headers = \char`\"{}.\+h\char`\"{}
\item C source code = \char`\"{}.\+c\char`\"{}
\item C++ headers = \char`\"{}.\+H,.\+hpp\char`\"{}
\item C++ source code = \char`\"{}.\+C,.\+cpp\char`\"{}
\item F90 source code = \char`\"{}.\+f90\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Indentation and line lengths
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item An indent is 3 (or 4) spaces
\item All code must be consistently \char`\"{}block indented\char`\"{} in multiples of 3 (or 4) space indentations
\item We strongly prefer to not have \char`\"{}tab\char`\"{} characters in our sources
\item We strongly prefer to not have lines greater than 80 characters in length.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Currently, there are no style checking or forcing mechanisms for Plas\+Com2. One can be certain that if the above style guide is followed, that nobody will complain about the resulting code formatting, but as long as a code is readable, understandable, and maintainable then that is the main overarching concern.
