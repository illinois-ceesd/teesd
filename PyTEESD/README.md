# Python package for TEESD

This is a set of Python interfaces and utilities for the [TEESD](https://github.com/illinois-ceesd/teesd)
project that tests CEESD components, integrated codes, and computational kernels. Kernels are often written in F90 codes, then parsed by [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy) to generate OpenCL kernels targeting modern HPC platforms.

## teesd

Python module (teesd.py) automatically generated by CMake which captures some information
about the environment, location of kernel F90 source files, etc. CMake uses the
(generate_teesd_python_module.sh) utility to build the Python module at configuration-time.

## parteesd

Python module (parteesd.py) with some parallel utilities including error checking, and
parallel XML tools.

## abate

Python module (abate.py) encapsulates some ABaTe-specific functions for interacting with
CDash testing dashboard through the automated build-and-test system.  The ABaTe suite also
includes (generate_suite_runner.py) which is a utility used by ABaTe to form platform-specific
batch scripts that execute the test suites. ABaTe also includes the checktest utility
(CheckTest.py) that checks test results after batch scripts have run.

## Profiler

Python parallel profiler class (profiler.py) supporting parallel timings, automatic
barriers, timer reduction, and reporting.
